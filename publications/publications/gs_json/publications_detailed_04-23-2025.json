Our findings reveal that RECCs possess distinct heterotetrameric cores composed of active and inactive RNase III endonucleases, which recognize gRNA-mRNA hybrids. Although the cores bind double-stranded RNAs in similar orientations, auxiliary zinc finger domains distinguish the secondary structures at deletion and insertion sites, while asymmetry in the endonucleolytic active centers directs the selection of scissile bonds. Peripheral heterotetramers of largely disordered oligonucleotide-binding (OB-fold) proteins flexibly attach exonuclease, TUTase, and ligase enzymatic subunits to the core. An embedded tRNA locks a core-peripheral interface in both complexes. This architecture facilitates the trimming or extension of cleaved mRNA …",

Differential subcellular localization of the cytoplasmic splicing machinery and a nuclear enzyme responsible for queuosine modification at the anticodon “wobble” position appear to be important quality control mechanisms for tRNATyr, the only intron-containing tRNA in T. brucei. Since tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), the enzyme responsible for Q formation, cannot act on an intron-containing tRNA, retrograde nuclear transport is an essential step in maturation.

In 30 years since editing was discovered in mitochondria of trypanosomes, several functionally and evolutionarily unrelated mechanisms have been described in eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Editing events are predominantly post-transcriptional and include nucleoside insertions and deletions, and base substitutions and modifications. Here, we review the mechanism of uridine insertion/deletion mRNA editing in kinetoplastid protists typified by Trypanosoma brucei. This type of editing corrects frameshifts, introduces translation punctuation signals, and often adds hundreds of uridines to create protein-coding sequences. We focus on protein complexes responsible for editing reactions and their interactions with other elements of the mitochondrial gene expression pathway.",

RET2 terminal uridylyl transferase is an integral component of the RNA editing core complex (RECC) and is responsible for the guide-RNA-dependent U insertion reaction. By analyzing RNA-interference-based knock-in Trypanosoma brucei cell lines, purified editing complex, and individual protein, we have investigated RET2's association with the RECC. In addition, the U insertion activity exhibited by RET2 as an RECC subunit was compared with characteristics of the monomeric protein. We show that interaction of RET2 with RECC is accomplished via a protein–protein contact between its middle domain and a structural subunit, MP81. The recombinant RET2 catalyzes a faithful editing on gapped (precleaved) double-stranded RNA substrates, and this reaction requires an …",

In Leishmania these proteins are labeled LC-1, LC-4, and LC-7b, and the orthologs in Trypanosoma brucei are labeled MP81, MP63, and MP42. Overexpression of TAP-tagged LC-4 in Leishmania tarentolae led to a partial localization of the protein in the L-complex together with the endogenous LC-4 protein, suggesting at least a dimeric organization. Disruption of zinc fingers 1 or 2 (ZnF-1 and ZnF-2) in the tagged LC-4 protein was performed by mutation of the two zinc-binding cysteines to glycines. Disruption of ZnF-1 led to a partial growth defect and a substantive breakdown of the L-complex, whereas disruption of ZnF-2 had no effect on cell …",

In Leishmania tarentolae, the core L-complex contains approximately 16 polypeptides including the two RNA ligases, REL1 and REL2 [1, 2]. Initially, the L-complex was identified by labeling the component RNA ligases with 32P-ATP. This labeled complex sedimented in a glycerol gradient from 20 to 25S and migrated in a native gel as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 1200–2000kDa. A second more intensely labeled complex which sedimented at around 12S–15S and migrated in a native gel as a doublet band at an apparent molecular weight of approximately 700kDa was termed the intermediate or I-complex [3]. We have shown that the I-complex could be labeled with 32P-ATP in the absence of Mg2+; since Mg2+ was required for adenylation of the REL1 and REL2 RNA ligases, this indicated that I-complex labeling was not due to adenylation of REL1 and REL2 [2]. We have also shown that the labeling of the I-complex is not covalent since the label was released by 55◦ C heat treatment of the gel and by exposure to low pH (data not shown); furthermore, extraction of the 32P-ATP-labeled I-complex yielded predominately 32P-ADP (not shown). In order to further characterize the I-complex, it was purified from L. tarentolae mitochondrial extract by glycerol gra-",

Significant N-and C-terminal portions of the protein were found to be dispensable for UTP polymerization in vitro. Changes of conserved amino acids in the active site demonstrated a general similarity of sugar-phosphate moiety recognition of the incoming ribonucleotide triphosphate by RET1 and eukaryotic poly (A) polymerases. Overlapping RNA-binding and oligomerization regions were mapped to the C-terminal region, which is conserved only among trypanosomatid RET1 enzymes. In the absence of an RNA primer, RET1 can use UTP itself to initiate nucleotide transfer and produce poly (U) molecules of several hundred nucleotides. An N-terminal zinc finger motif is essential for enzyme activity; deletion of this motif or chelation of zinc inhibits activity.Transfer of a nucleotide to an acceptor hydroxyl group is a fundamental chemical reaction involved in a variety of biological processes. Among many enzyme superfamilies that perform this reaction, the DNA polymerase ß-type group of nucleotidyltransferases is one of most widespread. Members of this group are involved in such diverse pathways as DNA repair, RNA processing, antibiotic resistance, and signal transduction (1). They include poly (A) polymerase (PAP), 1 CCA-adding enzymes, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, and others.

Several protein complexes have been isolated which exhibit some editing activities, and the macromolecular organization of these complexes is being analyzed. In addition, there have been several important technical advances in the in vitro analysis of editing.

    "abstract": "Location of phosphodiester bonds essential for aminoacylation of bovine tRNTrp was identified using a randomly cleaved transcript synthesized in vitro. It was found that cleavage of phosphodiester bonds after nucleotides in positions 21, 22, 36–38, 57–59, 62 and 64 were critical for aminoacylation capacity of tRNATrp-transcript. These cleavage sites were located in the regions of tRNA molecule protected by the cognate synthetase against chemical modification and in the regions presumably outside the contact area as well. These results indicate that for maintenance of aminoacylation ability the intactness of the certain regions of the tRNA backbone structure is necessary. Random splitting of non-modified RNA with alkali followed by separation of active and inactive molecules and identification of cleavage sites developed in this work may become a general approach for studying the role of RNA covalent structure …",
